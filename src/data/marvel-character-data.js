He uses a suit with mechanical wings forged from Chitauri technology.[15] Toomes is revealed to be the father of Liz, Parker's love interest.[16] Director Jon Watts wanted him to be a \"regular guy\", closer to John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) than other MCU villains like Thanos and Ultron, to go with Spider-Man as a \"regular kid who becomes a superhero\".[17][15] This helped avoid Toomes drawing the attention of the Avengers, and provided someone that Parker would be able to defeat while still learning to use his abilities.[18] Keaton said Toomes was not completely villainous, as \"there's parts of him that you go, 'You know what? I might see his point'.\"[19] Co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll likened Toomes to \"the dark Tony Stark\",[15] a \"businessman with a family. He wants to look out for his kids ... He doesn't have these big delusions of grandeur where he wants to take over the world, or replace the government, or even defeat the Avengers or anything. He just wants his shot at the good life.\"[20] Keaton was not hesitant to portray another comic book character after playing Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 film and its 1992 sequel.[19]",

Prolonged exposure to Extremis also grants him the ability to breathe fire. On taking the role, Pearce said, \"I feel a little more experimental in what I'll take on these days, but I still don't know that I would want to play the superhero myself, since I'm playing a different kind of character in this film ... The main difference was that, when I did The Time Machine, I was pretty much in all of it, so it was a really grueling experience. Prometheus and Iron Man are really kind of cameo stuff, so the experience of shooting them ... I mean, on some level, it's tricky because you feel like a bit of an outsider. You don't really live the experience that you do when you're there all day every day with everybody. But at the same time, it can be more fun sometimes because you're just working in concentrated spurts.\"[19] Pearce described his character as a man \"who came into this world with a number of physical disabilities. He's never been able to accept those limitations though and has spent most of his life trying to overcome them in any way he can. His tenacity and blind determination in fighting for a better life are seen by some as irritating, as he often comes across as obnoxious. He just won't accept the cards he was dealt, and being as intelligent as he is, has real drive to change and become a different person.\"[16] Shane Black specified, \"Ultimately we do give you the Mandarin, the real guy, but it's Guy Pearce in the end with the big dragon tattooed on his chest.\"[17] He elaborated, \"Do they hand me a blank check and say, 'Go break something!' Or, 'Go violate some long-standing comic book treaty that fans have supported for years?' No, but they'll say: 'Let's break something together.' So it's okay to come up with these crazy things, these far out ideas ... and they'll fly. It's just that the Marvel guys have to be in the room.\"[20]",

You have to realize you are probably the most powerful thing you could imagine. And you have to be that. You can't pretend, so that when you face Thor, it's real.\"[34] Akinnuoye-Agbaje stated the role required three hours of make-up a day and had to put on heavy duty prosthetics explaining, \"The outfit weighed about 40 pounds. I'm sure there will be a certain amount of CGI but a good 80% was me in that suit.\"[34] About the character Akinnuoye-Agbaje said, \"I suppose Algrim and Kurse would be the quintessential baddies, but in reality they are what I perceive as the scorn and the victims of the story. They are the elves who have basically lost their planet and their race to another race, the Asgardians. Here is a man/alien who places a noble objective beyond his own life and I think there is something extremely inspiring about that because he looks at the bigger picture and sees himself as a means to that end.\" Akinnuoye-Agbaje added, \"I worked with director Alan Taylor in trying to maintain Algrim's humanity all the way throughout Kurse's transformation, so that even when you see Kurse the beast, you can still relate to him as being Algrim inside. And symbolically we did that by keeping the same piercing blue eyes throughout.\"[17]",

    "description": "A Celtic mystic,[45] who becomes Strange's mentor.[17] The character in the comics is a Tibetan man, a situation which co-writer C. Robert Cargill compared to the Kobayashi Maru, an unwinnable training exercise in the Star Trek universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian Fu Manchu stereotype, and would involve the film with the Tibetan sovereignty debate, but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.[22][46] Derrickson wanted to change the character to an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the Dragon Lady stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting Asian fetish and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",[22] Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".[46] Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.[47] Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as androgynous, while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.[48][49] Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as whitewashing.[50] In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"[22]",

He also delivered lines slowly to avoid any time stretching issues.[25] Diesel recorded Groot's voice for sixteen foreign-language releases of the film (up from six in the first film).[26] Sean Gunn provided on-set reference for adolescent Groot in the post-credit sequence.[27]",

So, in a way, that was what I had to think of: how revenge can make you absolutely monomaniacal—though you're still trying to make it recognizably motive-led. It's just the personification of movie evil.\"[23] However Taylor stated that a lot of scenes involving Malekith's backstory had to be cut from the film to make it more efficient.[31] Eccleston revealed that he speaks an invented language for the film explaining, \"The Elvish language is definitely based on European languages. I think there’s probably some Finnish in there. It does have its logic and its rhythms. It also has many syllables and it's very difficult to do while remaining naturalistic. It's been a particular challenge for us but hopefully it gives the film some complexity and variety.\"[17] Eccleston also said the role required six hours of make-up and 45 minutes in wardrobe.[30]",

It's very early days yet, but I'm so thrilled to be on board.\"[34] On his performance, Kingsley stated: \"I wanted a voice that would disconcert a Western audience. I wanted a voice that would sound far more homegrown and familiar—a familiarity like a teacher's voice or a preacher's voice. The rhythms and tones of an earnest, almost benign, teacher—trying to educate people for their own good.\"[35] The Mandarin was initially set to appear in the first Iron Man film, but he was put off for a sequel as the filmmakers felt that he was \"too ambitious for a first [film].\"[36] On the character, Feige stated, \"The Mandarin is [Iron Man's] most famous foe in the comics mainly because he's been around the longest. If you look, there's not necessarily a definitive Mandarin storyline in the comics. So it was really about having an idea.\"[13] Shane Black explains that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is not Chinese in the film as he is in the comics in order to avoid the Fu Manchu stereotype: \"We're not saying he's Chinese, we're saying he, in fact, draws a cloak around him of Chinese symbols and dragons because it represents his obsessions with Sun Tzu in various ancient arts of warfare that he studied.\" The filmmakers also cited Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now as an influence for the character.[37] The videos where the Mandarin gives historical background to the attacks expressed how it emerged as the product of \"a think tank of people trying to create a modern terrorist.\"[27] Thus the Mandarin \"represents every terrorist in a way,\" from South American insurgency tactics to the videos of Osama bin Laden.[37]",

We did not hire James Spader to do a robot voice.\"[67] Extensive scans were taken of Spader's head and body in preparation for the role.[68] About the character Whedon said, \"He's always trying to destroy the Avengers, goddamn it, he's got a bee in his bonnet. He's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. He's got pain. And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff.\"[69] Whedon added that Ultron is \"not a creature of logic—he's a robot who's genuinely disturbed. We're finding out what makes him menacing and at the same time endearing and funny and strange and unexpected, and everything a robot never is.\"[70] Whedon compared Ultron to Frankenstein's monster, saying, \"It's our new Frankenstein myth [...] We create something in our own image and the thing turns on us. It has that pain of 'Well, why was I made? I want to kill Daddy.'\"[71] Spader called the character \"self-absorbed\" and added, \"I think he sees the Avengers as being part of a problem, a more comprehensive problem in the world. He sees the world from a very strange, [biblical] point of view because he's brand new, he's very young... He's immature, and yet has knowledge of comprehensive, broad history and precedent, and he has created in a very short period of time a rather skewed worldview.\"[72] Spader elaborates, \"He truly is an artificial intelligence with absolutely no censorship at all, no parameters really … he's got too much power, too much strength and speed and size, so he's a very dangerous child.\"[73]",

When Pearson started working on the film, he moved away from that storyline, instead focusing more on \"the mutual respect\" between the characters and Valkyrie \"dealing with her PTSD. She's someone who's drowning her sorrows in the bottle, and I just thought that was such a cool thing that you don't often see\".[18] Thompson stated that the character is bisexual, which she based on the character's comic book relationship with Annabelle Riggs, and convinced Waititi to shoot a glimpse of a woman walking out of Valkyrie's bedroom which was later cut from the film as Waititi thought that it distracted from the scene's exposition.[31] Thompson was inspired by pictures of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) while training for the role,[29] and worked with dialect coach Andrew Jack to create an Asgardian-sounding accent that was different enough to sound like she had been away from there for a long time.[32] Thompson will appear in future MCU films.[11][33]",
